# Analysis_CLAS6

This file is meant as a guide through how to understand this analysis framework for double charged pion electroproduction off the proton. The purpose of this analysis is to extract the polarization observables as well as the electron beam helicity asymmetry for this reaction. 

There is another repository called *analysis* on this GitHub, but please feel free to ignore that one. While it accomplishes goals up until raw yields, it is by no means a complete analysis and is significantly clunkier.
